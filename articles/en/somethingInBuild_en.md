# AI: Only Serves Those with Clear Goals

Recently, as I was job hunting, I needed a project to showcase my abilities, so I temporarily created this website from last week (the 24th) until today.
All the code for this site is on cyouhanki.github, using only CSS+HTML+JS to generate a static website.

In the future, I may add aesthetically pleasing and practical animations and 3D effects.

## Issues During Website Construction

During this website construction, I encountered two problems:

1. The original Hexo server I was using eventually became unusable. It seemed to generate folders in an infinite loop.
2. I gave the AI assistant too many permissions, and it deleted my repository (happened twice, lol).

## Lessons Learned

I wrote this article to share my experiences regarding these issues.

In 2018, I discovered Hexo+GitHub and built a static blog. Even in 2025, I wanted to conveniently rebuild a site using Hexo, but I was betrayed by Hexo.

So I turned to Cursor and DeepSeek, considering rebuilding the site from zero from an AI assistant's perspective.

**Technical Requirements**: You only need to understand the basic purposes of HTML, CSS, and JS.

During my AI usage, I was heavily dependent on Cursor for the first few days, giving the AI significant permissions, including root directory searches, file deletions, and file additions. As a result, on the morning of the 28th, Cursor deleted my repository.

After that, I adjusted my approach. When having the AI assistant write code, I told it which files to modify and didn't give it permissions beyond code modifications. However, when connecting to my own repository, I entrusted it to the AI assistant, and it deleted my repository again (second time).

## Personal Reflections

From my experience, I can say:

1. AI technology can create excellent projects
2. But when using AI technology, you yourself must have knowledge reserves and at least understand the big framework
3. Patience is necessary

That's all. If you have any job opportunities, please contact me! I truly cherish every opportunity.
