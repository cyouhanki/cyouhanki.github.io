# Book Review: Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Two Systems of Thought

The core concept of the book revolves around two cognitive systems:

- System 1: Fast, automatic, intuitive thinking
- System 2: Slow, effortful, rational thinking

## Key Concepts

### Anchoring Effect

When making judgments, we unconsciously rely on initial information:

> The first price offered by a real estate agent influences the buyer's expectations.

### Availability Bias

We tend to judge probability based on easily recalled examples:

- After seeing car accident news, we overestimate traffic accident risks
- Hearing lottery success stories increases our perception of winning chances

## Practical Implications

1. Be aware of System 1's limitations in important decisions
2. Give yourself time to engage System 2 for deeper thinking
3. Be vigilant about various cognitive biases

## Personal Reflection

This book has deepened my understanding of human cognition and improved my decision-making process in daily life.
